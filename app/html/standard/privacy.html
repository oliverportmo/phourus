<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Phourus takes privacy very seriously, so understanding the different privacy settings available for posts, users and organizations is vital to walking the thin line between privacy and expression.</p>

<h3>Post Privacy Settings</h3>
<p>Each post a user creates on Phourus has advanced privacy settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public:</strong> Public posts are made available to everyone, including search engines, and may be used for anonymous data analysis</li>
<li><strong>Phourus:</strong> 'Phourus' posts are made available to all logged-in Phourus users, but not search engines, and may be used for anonymous data analysis</li>
<li><strong>Friends:</strong> 'Friends' on Phourus are users who follow each other mutually. Posts with this setting will be made available to all 'Friends' of the author, but not search engines. These posts may also be used for anonymous data analysis</li>
<li><strong>Following:</strong> Posts with the 'Following' privacy setting are made available exclusively to all users the author is currently following. These posts can be used for anonymous data analysis, but not search engines.</li>
<li><strong>Followers:</strong> This setting is the same as the 'Following' setting, except it is for those following the author, rather than those the author is following.</li>
<li><strong>Private:</strong> Private posts are made available only to the author, and may not be used by search engines or anonymous data analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>User &amp; Org Privacy</h3>
<p>Users and Organizations are the lifeblood of Phourus, and has implemented features to validate their identity. Personal information will NEVER be sold to a 3rd party, such as the phone, email, address or name of a user or organization. Phourus is not in the business of selling mailing lists, emails, or any similar products, but in the business of <em>representation</em>.</p>

<p>User and Org information may be used anonymously to draw conclusions from the data given, but this data will never contain personal information, and will be aggregate data consisting of hundreds or even thousands of users/organizations. This enables Phourus to create valuable conclusions that can be resold to it's clients, without compromising the privacy of it's users.</p>

<h3>Data Usage</h3>
<p>One of the primary goals of Phourus is to better represent the ideas, thoughts, opinions and concerns of United States citizens. The internet is an ideal tool for accomplishing this goal, and the technology available today can make processing and analyzing massive amounts of data possible.</p>

<h4>Phourus may...</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use non-private data ANONYMOUSLY to draw data conclusions on it's user's behalf and resell this information to 3rd parties</li> 
<li>Make 'public' posts available to search engines</li> 
<li>Offer an alternative (such as advertisements) for users who do not wish their public information to be used in data mining processes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Phourus may not...</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sell User or Org information to 3rd parties for any reason. This covers mailing lists, personal information, addresses etc., but does not cover anonymous data analysis techniques, as explained in the 'Phourus may...' section.</li>
<li>Use personal identification information in any data processing and analysis</li>
<li>Use Org or User information for search engines without permission</li>
</ul>

<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p>Openness is the last essential element to the Phourus Privacy Policy. ALL of the source code for Phourus is available via <a href="http://github.com/phourus/phourus" target="_blank">github</a> to ensure transparency. Developers can even download Phourus and run it on their own computer using the provided sample DB.</p>

<p>The only aspect of the Phourus app that is proprietary, (aside from certain internal business tools), is the actual live, production database, which contains all of the posts and user/org information entrusted to Phourus by it's users. For privacy concerns, this data is not available to the public, though may be made available in the future to credible auditing agencies to ensure data integrity and proper representation.</p>

<h3>More Information</h3>
<p>Please <a href="/#contact">let Phourus know</a> of any concerns you may have regarding this policy. Our top priority is user trust, and without your feedback we are limited in our capabilities.</p>
