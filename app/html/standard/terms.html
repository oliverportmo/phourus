<h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
<p>Phourus is built around personal expression, and welcomes unusual, opinionated and even radical/extreme points of views, as long as it falls within the following guidelines. Violations of these terms may result in account termination in extreme cases, and lower Influence ranks with lesser violations.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li>First off, use proper judgment! Phourus is about peer-to-peer expression, and the more dignified and proper the expression the more likely it will be accepted and praised by the community.</li>
<li>Personal threats, slanderous posts or discussing illegal activity is strictly prohibited and may result in account termination. Discussing whether or not something should be legal or illegal, however, is permitted.</li>
<li>Colorful language is accepted, but not encouraged. By offending other users, you are running the risk of losing Influence and getting your post buried in rankings. You are here to impress and inspire others, so be aware that some may be offended by your language and may cause your post to lose Influence.</li>
<li>Bigoted or hateful posts are reluctantly accepted, as long as it does not cross the line of being violent or illegal. However, keep in mind just because it is permitted, it is not recommended, because it will quickly lose Influence and visibility. It is accepted because Phourus is a platform for open expression, not because it is encouraged.</li>
<li>Nudity, pornography, or anything related is strictly prohibited and can result in account termination.</li>
<li>In general, be diplomatic in your posts. Phourus is about creating content that users respect, and it won't take long until your account and posts will be at the bottom if you offend others, at which point there is no point in even having an account.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reporting Violations</h3>
<p>Violations of the Phourus Terms &amp; Conditions should be reported to Phourus. Multiple violations may result in account termination, and even a single violation can cause visibility to drop significantly.</p>

<p>In the case that you are offended by a post, but it is not in direct violation of the rules, simply give it a 'Thumbs' down and do not comment or view the post again. Thumbs down, low view and comment counts keep the post Influence rank down, making it less visible to the rest of Phourus.</p>
