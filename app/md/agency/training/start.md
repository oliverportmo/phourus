Phourus is an American company focused on the USA exclusively. In addition to strengthening the USA with Phourus.com, an exciting, innovative tool for communities, Phourus also takes a different approach to employment, that not only benefits Phourus, but the citizens of the USA. Despite economic certainty in most of the US, the tech industry is booming, and even newly minted programmers and developers can make close to 6 figures without a college degree. The shortage of American talent is forcing tech giants to push for more H1B visas, so foreigners can fill the positions Americans are unqualified for.

Phourus sees opportunity in this situation. The Phourus Training Program aims to take anybody who is interested in learning programming and get them started for free by training them to work on the real, live Phourus app. They start out with the tutorial, learn the fundamentals, then begin working on small tasks for Phourus. Once they've reached a certain comfort level, Phourus can provide them jobs from the Phourus Agency so they can make extra money and build a portfolio. By the time they are ready for a full-time job, they'll have done some freelancing, helped build a real app, and learned all the fundamentals.
