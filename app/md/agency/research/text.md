While pretty graphs, statistics and big data are all the rage right now, textual analysis is beginning to emerge as an equally as vital tool, or at least in some instances. Natural Language Processing (NLP), is a highly-complex process that is used to teach computers how to become literate. This does not mean simple keyword pulling and grammar analysis. Some of the leading players in NLP solutions go far beyond simply understanding what the content is about. Our NLP partner OpenAmplify is even working on algorithms to process sarcasm and other contextual information, no easy task when dealing with the typical 'black and white' world of computing.

Textual analysis is great for analyzing large amount of text collected from product reviews, customer feedback, support tickets, user-generated content, user comments and more.
